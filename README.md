# Customer-Segmentation-with-Artificial-Intelligence

### K-mean Clustering Theory

ðŸ“Œ It is used to divide a large number of raw data into groups.

ðŸ“Œ We need to pre-classify the raw data.

ðŸ“Œ Artificial intelligence does the classification for you, you don't need to guide it, it does all the work by itself (it belongs to the group of unsupervised lerarning models.)

ðŸ“Œ It is the most widely used of the Unsupervised Learning models.

ðŸ“Œ It uses the centroid system (round shapes) while doing this.
